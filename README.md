**OWStreamRecordEx**

This program is designed to record your points and wins / losses in a file, and then you can add this file to the OBS for the stream

Program can capture overwatch in GDI + mode and through OBS

If the GDI + mode is active, then the overwatch must be in windowed or borderless windowed mode

To play in full screen mode you need to enable OBS

OBS mode works through my obs [plugin](https://github.com/EugW/OWStreamRecordExRec), which you need to download and install

Then go to OBS -> Overwatch source -> Filters -> Add OWStreamRecordExRec filter -> You're ready!


Remember it's first release ever, so many bugs here
